## How To Use

Use to cat an image to the terminal, see the help text below for more
information on using this tool from the command line:

```bash
usage: catimage [-h] [-u] [-b] [-c CHAR] [-t] [-g | -r] image

cat an image to the terminal

positional arguments:
  image                 image file or url

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --url             image is a URL
  -b, --big             big image
  -c CHAR, --char CHAR  char to use in colour print use $'chr' for escaped chars
  -t, --disable-truecolour
                        disable output in truecolour

choose one of the following:
  use the following arguments to change the look of the image

  -g, --greyscale       output image in greyscale (best for terminals that cannot handle ANSI)
  -r, --regular         output image in regular definition
```

GUI

Use the --cli2gui flag to launch a GUI

<img src="readme-assets/screenshots/desktop/gui-1.png" alt="GUI 2" width="600">
</div>

Alternatively, import into your project and use:

```python
def generateHDColour(imageName, maxLen, trueColour=True, char="\u2584"):
	"""Iterate through image pixels to make a printable string

	Args:
		imageName (str): path of the image on the filesystem (relative of
		absolute)
		maxLen (int): maximum of width and height in chars
		trueColour (bool, optional): print in true colour. Defaults to True.
		char (str, optional): use this char for each pixel. Defaults to "\u2584".

	Returns:
		str: string to print
	"""

def generateColour(imageName, maxLen, trueColour=True, char="\u2588"):
	"""Iterate through all of the pixels in an image and construct a printable
	string

	Args:
		imageName (str): path of the image on the filesystem (relative of
		absolute)
		maxLen (int): maximum of width and height in chars
		trueColour (bool, optional): print in true colour. Defaults to True.
		char (str, optional): use this char for each pixel. Defaults to "\u2588".

	Returns:
		str: string to print
	"""

def generateGreyscale(imageName, maxLen):
	"""Iterate through image pixels to make a printable string

	Args:
		imageName (str): path of the image on the filesystem (relative of
		absolute)
		maxLen (int): maximum of width and height in chars

	Returns:
		str: string to print
	"""

## Documentation

A high-level overview of how the documentation is organized organized will help you know
where to look for certain things:

<!--
- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get
  started using the software. Start here if youâ€™re new.
-->
- The [Technical Reference](/documentation/reference) documents APIs and other aspects of the
  machinery. This documentation describes how to use the classes and functions at a lower level
  and assume that you have a good high-level understanding of the software.
<!--
- The [Help](/documentation/help) guide provides a starting point and outlines common issues that you
  may have.

```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/catimage/ for more info

## Language information

### Built for

This program has been written for Python versions 3.8 - 3.11 and has been tested with both 3.8 and
3.11

## Install Python on Windows

### Chocolatey

```powershell
choco install python
```

### Windows - Python.org

To install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the latest
version.

## Install Python on Linux

## How to run

### Windows

- Module
	`py -3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)

- File
	`py -3.x [file]` or `./[file]`

### Linux/ MacOS

	`python3.x [file]` or `./[file]`

## Building

This project uses https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/FHMake to automate most of the building. This
command generates the documentation, updates the requirements.txt and builds the library artefacts

Note the functionality provided by fhmake can be approximated by the following

```sh
handsdown  --cleanup -o documentation/reference
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with dev --output requirements_optional.txt
poetry build
```

`fhmake audit` can be run to perform additional checks

## Testing

For testing with the version of python used by poetry use

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

Alternatively use `tox` to run tests over python 3.8 - 3.11

```sh
tox
```
